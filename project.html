        <h2>The Problem:</h2>
          <p>Users were frustrated with juggling multiple apps to manage their day and collaborate with others on projects.
          </p>
        <h2>The Solution:</h2>
          <p>I created a cloud storage application with administrative features that allows users to save, organize, create, and upload content, while connecting and collaborating in real-time.

            <h3>User Research</h3>
              <p>I conducted a user survey to better understand how and why users use cloud storage. I knew that users liked that they could quickly share content with others, but I wanted to know if they had a process for brainstorming, such as using
                mood or vision boards.

              <p>51% percent of of participants might use a cloud storage app to create a vision, 18.9% said they would use it.

              <p>After learning about the most popular cloud storage applications used by my survey participants, I decided to investigate the key differences between Google Drive, Dropbox and iCloud by conducting a SWOT Analysis. I wanted to learn
                where their strengths are and where they fall short in order to best determine the most important features and how we could enter the market. Some of the strengths were excellent integration and the opportunity to create content within,
                while a weakness was lack of ability to support tagging. While Google Drive and Dropbox do not support tagging, this creates an opportunity for a competitor to enter the market, which will allow users to connect and collaborate quicker.

            <h3>User Stories</h3>
              <p>Derived from the goals and frustrations,
                I created User Stories that show the users potential tasks.

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
              <p>When I began wireframing, I sketched out the layout of every page before digitizing it. Along the way I made some design decisions to improve the layout. I noticed that horizontal scrolling was not as intuitive on desktops, therefore,
                changed the calendar to a vertical scroll that moves with real-time.

            <h3>Additional Testing</h3>

              <p>Once the digital wireframes were created I conducted usability testing to gain insight on how others view and move through the site. The findings were that it was not intuitive to look in drive for the Upload button. This was solved
                by creating a CTA button on the homepage. I continued to conduct additional testing quickly by creating a paper prototype to conduct preference testing. The findings were that users would like to see a To-Do section on their homepage
                higher in the hierarchy.

              <h3>Research and Sketching</h3>
                <p>In order to decide on a brand name, I created a mind map based on our user personas and words that arose when talking about cloud storage.
                </p>
                <img src="images/mindmap" alt="">
                <p>Our product helps turn dreams and ideas into a reality by having everything you need in one place. From our mind mapping experience, I decided on the brand name: Vision, and created a list of words that come to mind when thinking
                  about vision.</p>
                <img src="list-making" alt="">
                <p>Vision incorporates our product's mission of aligning with your vision or goal, with the added opportunity to create vision boards. I knew I wanted the V in Vision to be part of the logo and for users to feel a sense of clarity and
                  a clear path to reach their destination.

              <h3>Refining</h3>
                <p>After sketching out logos, I knew that the logo was to remain simple in order to convey a clean feel. I brought my favorite designs into Figma and began exploring the concepts until I reached my final design.

              <h3>Hi-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
                <p> With the style guide created, I built out the first high fidelity desktop and mobile prototype and conducted preference tests to ensure positive design decisions. It was important to make sure that both mobile and desktop designs
                  remained cohesive.</p>

                <img src="images/preference-test-2.png" alt="">
                <img src="images/first-hifi.png" alt="">
                <p>From the preference test for the Quick Access and Drive layouts, I learned that half the users chose the horizontal swiping to view each section over clicking the carrot to change, and then vertical scrolling. From this I decided to
                  try a new approach that allowed users to easily change without excessive scrolling.

                  My User testing results were that both my desktop and mobile were easy to navigate. Creating a Create icon was beneficial to a simpler flow. Moving, sharing, and starring was streamlined across both mobile and desktop. The goal was to
                  keep things as uniform as possible across both devices.</p>

            <article>
              <h3>Final Outcome</h3>
                <p>
                  I created boxes for each section and used the light blue only for an upcoming event for the day and the document tiles. I changed the name of the original Calendar to Agenda, and created a separate section for a calendar so that users
                  could view both their agenda and monthly calendar on their homepage. The Agenda went back to a vertical scroll which the tick would move in real-time. The side navigation bar is collapsible, and it is on every page throughout the
                  prototype. Instead of having an upload button, there is a create icon where a pop out occurs with the options to create a document, spreadsheet, presentation, vision board, upload, and folder.

              <h3>Conclusion + Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                  After completing this project, I’ve gained a lot of insight into what worked and what didn’t. I learned that paper prototypes are a great way to quickly test an idea before building out a lo-fi version. Keeping all your sketches,
                  hand-drawn prototypes organized and together is extremely helpful when looking back and creating a case study. If I were to change something about the way I went about this project, it would be to constantly look back at the user
                  stories and user personas in order to stay within scope. I found myself getting excited about the additional features that I wanted to add onto the app that essentially I completely built out both a mobile app and desktop app and in the
                  end had to trim back some frames (I saved them though, just in case!) UsabilityHub turned out to be an excellent tool for quick A/B testing, which ended up being very helpful in my design decisions.
