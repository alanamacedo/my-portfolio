              <h3>User Research</h3>
              <p>I conducted a user survey to better understand how and why users use cloud storage. I knew that users liked that they could quickly share content with others, but I wanted to know if they had a process for brainstorming, such as
                using
                mood or vision boards.

              <p>After learning about the most popular cloud storage applications used by my survey participants, I decided to investigate the key differences between Google Drive, Dropbox and iCloud by conducting a SWOT Analysis. I wanted to learn
                where their strengths are and where they fall short in order to best determine the most important features and how we could enter the market. Some of the strengths were excellent integration and the opportunity to create content
                within,
                while a weakness was lack of ability to support tagging. While Google Drive and Dropbox do not support tagging, this creates an opportunity for a competitor to enter the market, which will allow users to connect and collaborate
                quicker.

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>When I began wireframing, I sketched out the layout of every page before digitizing it. Along the way I made some design decisions to improve the layout. I noticed that horizontal scrolling was not as intuitive on desktops, therefore,
              changed the calendar to a vertical scroll that moves with real-time. </p>
            <div class="wireframes">

            </div>
            <p class="add-margin-top">With my wireframes, I conducted in-person usability tests where I asked participants to accomplish four tasks: Add content, organize content, pin content to a Vision Board, and tag a user in a document. I started
              out each usability test asking the users to describe the homepage to me. Some feedback was that the alerts could be bolden or too create a separate notification section with an icon.
            </p>
            <p class="change-font">Adding Content</p>
            <p> In the homepage featured above, participants searched for an option to upload straight from the homepage. Once they could not find that option, they clicked "Drive". From there, users found the option to upload and completed the
              tasks. This tells me that uploading needs to be easy to achieve with a one step process directly on the homepage.</p>
            <p class="change-font">Organizing Content</p>

            <p class="add-margin-top">When asked to organize content, users attempted to right click any file on the homescreen. I made the mistake of not prototyping every file, and instead only prototyped the first folder in the drive. Once I they
              were in the drive, the particpants right clicked ont he folder and completed the move process. Participants liked the pop-up that notified the user where the file or folder moved.

            <p class="add-margin-top">Participants successfully pinned content to the Vision Board. The feedback received was that users don't need to be prompted as soon as they land on the page.

            <p>When asked to tag an individual, participants saw that they also had the option to comment. Participants completed the tasks, but wished that commenting and tagging were a single-step process.</p>

            <h3>Additional Testing</h3>
            <p>After conducting the first user tests with the digital wireframes, I conducted additional usability tests to gain insight on how others view and move through the site. The findings from the first usability test were that it was not
              intuitive to look in drive for the Upload button. This was solved
              by creating a CTA button on the homepage. I continued to conduct additional testing quickly by creating a paper prototype to conduct preference testing. The findings were that users would like to see a To-Do section on their homepage
              higher in the hierarchy.

              <p>In order to decide on a brand name, I created a mind map based on our user personas and words that arose when talking about cloud storage.

              <p class="add-margin-top">Our product helps turn dreams and ideas into a reality by having everything you need in one place. From our mind mapping experience, I decided on the brand name: Vision, and created a list of words that come to
                mind when thinking
                about vision.</p>

              <p>Vision incorporates our product's mission of aligning with your vision or goal, with the added opportunity to create vision boards. I knew I wanted the V in Vision to be part of the logo and for users to feel a sense of clarity and
                a clear path to reach their destination.

                For the Branding, I chose a blue color scheme with gray and purple accents. Blue is a calming color that also symbolizes progress. The bluish purple cta color stands out and is energizing and symbolizes connection.

            <h3>Hi-Fi Mockups and Testing</h3>
            <p>From the prior usability test, I iterated my designs and created High-Fidelity Mockups based on user feedback. I then continued onward conducting in-person testing with these mockups.</p>
            <p class="change-font">Desktop and Adding Content</p>
            <img src="images/Homepage.png" alt="" class="center add-margin-below large-image">
            <p>In this mockup, I created a Quick Access section where users have the option to switch between Recent, Starred, and Shared. This decision allows the most important aspects to be on display without having to scroll the page. Upload
              buttons were added to the homepage, and the Calendar was switched to a horizontal scroll which moves with actual-time. As for the side-navigation, I added icons to each menu item as well as the option to collaps the navigation. Instead
              of alerts being at the top center of the page, I added and alerts section with a drop-down menu for notifications. Particpants liked that the homepage made everything easily accessible and they could upload from here. However, the
              sections and the tiles are the same shade of blue and blend together.</p>
            <p class="change-font">Organizing Content</p>
            <img src="images/hifi-move.png" alt="" class="center add-margin-below large-image">
            <p>For organizing content, I prototyped the file and folder tiles and kept the process the same. I added the move-icon that is shown when you are inside a file. Users liked this and said it created consistency and acted as a reminder of
              the task at hand.</p>
            <p class="change-font">Pinning to Vision Board</p>
            <img src="images/hifi-vb-1.png" alt="" class="center add-margin-below large-image">
            <img src="images/hifi-vb-2.png" alt="" class="center add-margin-below large-image">
            <p>Pinning to a Vision Board, I changed the prompted pop up to a call-to-action blue tile. Once clicked, users are prompted with the option to include a hyperlink or to upload content. Participants liked this design better, and felt the
              CTA button was instinctive.</p>
            <p class="change-font">Tagging and Commenting</p>
            <img src="images/hifi-tc-1.png" alt="" class="center add-margin-below large-image">
            <img src="images/hifi-tc-2.png" alt="" class="center add-margin-below large-image">
            <p class="add-margin-below">In response to the feedback from the wireframe usability tests, I combined the tagging and commenting feature. It is still accessed by highlighting a section and right clicking "Tag/Comment". Here, the users
              type their tag or comment, and click enter. After clicking enter, a small post-it icon appears for the section where the comment is located, and the area remains highlighted. Participants liked this idea, but when it came to saving the
              post-it, half the participants were confused and required extra guidance.</p>
            <h3 class="add-margin-top">A/B Testing</h3>
            <p> With the style guide created, I built a mobile prototype and conducted preference tests to ensure positive design decisions. It was important to make sure that both mobile and desktop designs
              remained cohesive.</p>
            <div class="hi-fi-testing">
              <div class="ut-1">
                <img src="images/usability-test-1.png" alt="" class="center ut eighty-vw">
                <p> 52% of users chose swiping to view each section.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="ut-2">
                <img src="images/usability-test-2.png" alt="" class="center ut eighty-vw">
                <p> 52% of users chose the blue sections over dividers.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="add-margin-below"> From the preference test for the Quick Access and Drive layouts, I learned that half the users chose the horizontal swiping to view each section over clicking the carrot to change, and then vertical scrolling.
              From this I decided to
              try a new approach that allowed users to easily change without excessive scrolling.

              My User testing results were that both my desktop and mobile were easy to navigate. Creating a Create icon was beneficial to a simpler flow. Moving, sharing, and starring was streamlined across both mobile and desktop. The goal was to
              keep things as uniform as possible across both devices.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="add-margin-top">I created boxes for each section and used the light blue only for an upcoming event for the day and the document tiles. I changed the name of the original Calendar to Agenda, and created a separate section for a
              calendar so that users
              could view both their agenda and monthly calendar on their homepage. The Agenda went back to a vertical scroll which the tick would move in real-time. The side navigation bar is collapsible, and it is on every page throughout the
              prototype. Instead of having an upload button, there is a create icon where a pop out occurs with the options to create a document, spreadsheet, presentation, vision board, upload, and folder.

            <p class="end add-margin-below">
              After completing this project, I’ve gained a lot of insight into what worked and what didn’t. I learned that paper prototypes are a great way to quickly test an idea before building out a lo-fi version. Keeping all your sketches,
              hand-drawn prototypes organized and together is extremely helpful when looking back and creating a case study. If I were to change something about the way I went about this project, it would be to constantly look back at the user
              stories and user personas in order to stay within scope. I found myself getting excited about the additional features that I wanted to add onto the app that essentially I completely built out both a mobile app and desktop app and in the
              end had to trim back some frames (I saved them though, just in case!) UsabilityHub turned out to be an excellent tool for quick A/B testing, which ended up being very helpful in my design decisions.
